1. What are the Basic parts of a Computer ?
Answer :-
* Every modern computer system consists of three basic sections :-
    Input Devices 
    Processor(CPU)
        Control Unit(CU) - This component directs the operations of the CPU by fetching, decoding, and executing instructions. It controls the flow of data between the CPU and other parts of the computer.
        Arithmetic and Logical Unit(ALU) - This part of the CPU performs all arithmetic calculations (like addition and subtraction) and logical operations (like comparison operations).
        Memory Unit(MU) - This is the primary memory (RAM), which temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks.
    Output Devices
* Refer to Image - Basic Parts of Computer
* Concept from Image :-
    Input Devices to CPU - Data and instructions are entered into the computer via input devices (like keyboards and mice) and sent to the CPU for processing.
    Memory (main) to Control Unit (CU) - The main memory (RAM) stores the data and instructions temporarily. The Control Unit fetches these instructions from the main memory to begin processing.
    Control Unit to Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) - The Control Unit decodes the instructions and sends the relevant data and operations to the ALU for execution (arithmetic and logical operations).
    ALU to Control Unit - After the ALU performs the required operations, it sends the results back to the Control Unit.
    Control Unit to Memory (main) - The Control Unit may then send the results back to the main memory for storage, if needed.
    CPU to Output Devices - Finally, the processed data is sent from the CPU to the output devices (like monitors and printers) to be presented to the user.

2. What is a Memory ?
Answer :-
* Memory in a computer is where data is stored temporarily or permanently. It is essential for storing and retrieving data.
* The act of entering data into a storage location is called a Memory Write Operation.
* The act of retrieving data from a storage location is called a Memory Read Operation.
* "Data and instructions are moved, to and from memory, in bunches of word length" :-
